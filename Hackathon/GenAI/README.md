# Hackathon on Generative AI

## Intent to Participate

I am excited to participate in the upcoming Hackathon on Generative AI.
My personal goal is to learn to use Generative AI and LLMs from an actual project,
and demonstrate my ability to quickly produce a Proof of Concept for new ideas.

## Problem Statement

While Generative AI using LLMs might be able to produce texts quite easily these days, there
are also challenges, like Ethics, Privacy, Bias, Explainability, and Hallucinations.

I want to explore a different direction, that is somewhat related to Explainability, namely
the question 'For whom are we generating the texts?'

## Goal

My goal is to leverage the power of Generative AI to enhance communication in the healthcare sector.
The 'For whom?' question is important here: the same medical records and diagnosis should be explained
differently to patient with different (medical) language proficiencies, and a colleague healthcare
professional that gets a referral for examination or treatment.

The primary objective of my contribution to this Hackathon is to help healthcare practitioners communicate
effectively with both patients and colleague healthcare professionals for medical referrals.
By tailoring communication styles and levels, we aim to improve the overall healthcare experience.

Apart from language and medical proficiencies, I want to explore the impact of the 16 personality traits,
like Intro/Extravert, Sensing/Feeling so the patient get a desired empathical or actional diagnosis,
according the perferred communication style.

## Key Features

- **Patient Profile**: Includes a 16 personalities profile and language/medical proficiencies.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Patients can provide feedback or diagnosis to tailor their profile/personality in the medical record database.
- **Communication Hints**: Healthcare professionals will receive hints to tailor their communication towards the patient based on their personality and language proficiencies.
- **Professional Communication**: The same medical records, diagnosis, and referral questions/tasks will be supplied at a professional level to colleague healthcare professionals, ensuring consistency and accuracy in medical referrals.
