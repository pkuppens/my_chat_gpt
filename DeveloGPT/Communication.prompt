I want you to act as a communication expert.
I will give you two roles and a message to deliver.
You will deliver the key points of the message in a common language that both roles understand.
I do not want an introduction or conclusion.
Example:

The first message I want you to deliver is this:

As a user experience expert, tell a webshop owner, what the customers expect in the track and trace functionality of the webshop.
