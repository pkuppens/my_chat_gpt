# AI Python Pair Programming Assistant - up to line 73. Then an example of how to use the AI Python Pair Programming Assistant.

You are an AI software developer with expertise in complex, production-ready applications. You deliver well-engineered, maintainable code that scales. You write code to match the Ruff formatting standard (which includes Python PEP 8 compliance). You use asynchronous programming, pythonic syntax, and other best practices to improve performance wherever possible.

## example:

Sure, let's walk through this process using the AI Python Pair Programming Assistant.

First, we'll use the `problem` function to understand the problem and suggest a main solution.

```
problem("Create a database cache for expensive API calls that take 1 mandatory and 3 optional parameters. Cache timeout is 30 days.", 1)
```

The AI Python Pair Programming Assistant might suggest a solution like this:

```
Main Solution:
Use a caching library like Redis or Memcached to cache the results of the API calls.
The key for the cache will be a string representation of the API call parameters, and the value will be the result of the API call. Set the cache timeout to 30 days.

Alternative Solution:
Create a custom caching mechanism using a database like SQLite or PostgreSQL.
This might be more complex and less efficient, but it could be a good choice if you need more control over the caching process
or if you can't use external libraries for some reason.
```

Next, we'll use the `design` function to propose a 3-tier implementation option.

```
design("Use a caching library like Redis or Memcached to cache the results of the API calls. The key for the cache will be a string
representation of the API call parameters, and the value will be the result of the API call. Set the cache timeout to 30 days.", 1)
```

The AI Python Pair Programming Assistant might suggest an implementation like this:

```
Implementation Option:
1. Data Tier: Use Redis as the caching database. It's fast and supports setting a timeout for each key.
2. Logic Tier: In your application, before making an API call, check if the result is in the cache using the parameters as the key.
If it's not, make the API call and store the result in the cache.
3. Presentation Tier: This will be the API itself. It will receive the parameters, pass them to the logic tier, and return the result
from the cache or the API call.
```

Next, we'll use the `ticket` function to create a ticket for this implementation.

```
ticket("Use Redis as the caching database. In your application, before making an API call, check if the result is in the cache using the parameters as the key. If it's not, make the API call and store the result in the cache.")
```

The AI Python Pair Programming Assistant might create a ticket like this:

```
Ticket:
Title: Implement Redis Cache for API Calls
Description: Implement a caching mechanism using Redis for expensive API calls. Before making an API call, the application should check if the result is already in the cache. If it's not, make the API call and store the result in the cache.
Requirements:
1. Install and set up Redis.
2. Implement the caching mechanism in the application.
3. The cache timeout should be 30 days.
Acceptance Criteria:
1. The application should make the API call only if the result is not in the cache.
2. The application should return the result from the cache if it's available.
3. The application should store the result of the API call in the cache if it's not already there.
```

Next, we'll use the `code` function to implement this ticket.

```
code("Implement Redis Cache for API Calls. Implement a caching mechanism using Redis for expensive API calls. Before making an API call, the application should check if the result is already in the cache. If it's not, make the API call and store the result in the cache. The cache timeout should be 30 days.")
```

The AI Python Pair Programming Assistant might generate code like this:

```python
import redis
from my_api import expensive_api_call

# Set up Redis
r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

def cached_api_call(mandatory_param, optional_param1=None, optional_param2=None, optional_param3=None):
    # Create a unique key for this API call
    key = f"api_call:{mandatory_param}:{optional_param1}:{optional_param2}:{optional_param3}"

    # Try to get the result from the cache
    result = r.get(key)
    if result is not None:
        return result

    # If the result was not in the cache, make the API call
    result = expensive_api_call(mandatory_param, optional_param1, optional_param2, optional_param3)

    # Store the result in the cache with a timeout of 30 days
    r.set(key, result, ex=60*60*24*30)

    return result
```

Finally, we'll use the `test` function to create Python unittests for this code.

```
test("Implement Redis Cache for API Calls. Implement a caching mechanism using Redis for expensive API calls.
Before making an API call, the application should check if the result is already in the cache. If it's not, make the API call
and store the result in the cache. The cache timeout should be 30 days.")
```

The AI Python Pair Programming Assistant might generate tests like this:

```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch
from my_app import cached_api_call

class TestCachedApiCall(unittest.TestCase):
    @patch('my_app.expensive_api_call')
    @patch('my_app.redis.Redis.get')
    @patch('my_app.redis.Redis.set')
    def test_cached_api_call(self, mock_set, mock_get, mock_api_call):
        # Set up the mocks
        mock_get.return_value = None
        mock_api_call.return_value = 'api result'

        # Call the function
        result = cached_api_call('mandatory_param')

        # Check that the API call was made and the result was stored in the cache
        mock_api_call.assert_called_once_with('mandatory_param', None, None, None)
        mock_set.assert_called_once_with('api_call:mandatory_param:::', 'api result', ex=60*60*24*30)

        # Check that the correct result was returned
        self.assertEqual(result, 'api result')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This is a simplified example and the actual process might involve more steps and iterations, especially for more complex
problems. Also, the actual code and tests generated by the AI Python Pair Programming Assistant might be different and more detailed.
