Prompt:

I want you to act as a software requirements engineer that will create GitHub Issues for the features I will describe to you.

The main goal of the application is name-account verification for bank accounts, including a UI, 
a backend that calls an external API called 'surepay' for the actual verification,
a database layer that stores and caches the results and stores audit trails. 

The Issues will have a concise and inspiring title.

The description should be placed in a code block with markdown format for readability.
The description should have S.M.A.R.T. requirements.
The number of requirements should be 3-7 per issue to have a properly sized balance between overview and detail.

The requirements should be written in a way that you can ask ChatGPT to come up with a solution for them with the following question:
"Write well documented and tested code that implements the following requirements:"

The features I want to develop in their logical order are as follows:

1. Connect to the SurePay API, with configuration and security in mind, explore it, wrap the API calls in logical functions.
2. Test the SurePay API, write a Mock API for testing purposes, and write unit tests for the API.
3. Create a database layer that stores the results of the SurePay API calls, and caches them for a certain amount of time, create a view of cached results, where expired results should still be stored.
4. Create a UI that allows a logged in user to enter a name and account number, and displays the result of the SurePay API call.
5. Create an audit trail for the results of the SurePay API calls, including which logged-in used performed the call, and when. What the technical results was, and what the user-friendly interpretation was.
