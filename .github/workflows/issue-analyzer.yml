      # Configuration Notes:
      # - LLM_PROVIDER: Currently supports 'openai' (can be extended)

      # - OPENAI_API_KEY: Must be set in repository secrets
      # - GITHUB_TOKEN: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
      #
      # To configure:
      # 1. Go to repository Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
      # 2. Add OPENAI_API_KEY with your OpenAI API key
      # 3. Optionally override LLM_MODEL and other parameters below
