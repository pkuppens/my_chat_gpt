## Introduction

This directory contains a chat history download d.d. 12-6-2023, such that I can disable chat history and data sharing for training.

## Table of Contents

* chat.html - the chat history in html rendered format - quite plain, it does not use code blocks etc.
* conversation.json - the conversation in JSON format
* message_feedback.json - empty - the feedback to ChatGPT on the messages in JSON format?!
* model_comparison.json - empty - the comparison of the models in JSON format (results from regenerations?)
* user.json - the user information in JSON format - anonymized...
