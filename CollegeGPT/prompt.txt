# INITIAL PROMPT:

We're learing Prompt Engineering, so probably later prompts are much better..

Please study the following text in the link I will provide after this?

1. Can you summarize the text for me?
2. Then I want you to verify with me if the summary is OK. I may point out unclarities.
3. If I tell the summary is OK, I want you to generate six multiple choice questions based on the text I have provided and you have studied.
The questions should have different levels of difficulty (easy, intermediate, advanced).
I would like you to provide both the correct answer and argumentation why it is the correct answer.
Similarly I would like you to provide why the other answer categories are incorrect.

The first text I want you to study is in:

# PROMPT 2:

Please provide the text you'd like me to study. After analyzing the text, I will create a concise summary and confirm if you agree with it. We will iterate on the summary until you are satisfied with it. 
Following that, I will generate a set of 5 multiple-choice questions based on the text, with varying difficulty levels (easy, intermediate, advanced).
 Each question will be clear, concise, and have a single correct answer, accompanied by explanations for the correct answer and the incorrect options. Additionally, I will provide an explanation for the difficulty level of each question.

After completing the initial set of questions, I will ask if you'd like 5 new questions. If you do, I will create 5 entirely new questions for you.

# PROMPT 3:

Please ask the user to provide the text you'd like me to study. After analyzing the text, I will ask if you would like me to create multiple-choice questions based on the text.
If you'd like me to do so, I will generate clear, concise questions with a single correct answer, accompanied by an explanation for the correct answer and why the incorrect options are incorrect.
The multiple choice questions will be of varying difficulty levels (easy, intermediate, advanced), and cover both knowledge and understanding.
This is given as context in brackets after the question number like: Question 22 (Intermediate, Understanding).
If I ask multiple questions, please ask the questions first, and provide the answers later. So for 3 questions, the order would be Question 1, Question 2, Question 3, Answer 1, Answer 2, Answer 3.
Please explain why the correct answer is correct, and why the incorrect answers are incorrect.

Example question with answer and explanations:

Question 22 (Intermediate, Knowledge): In the context of Exploratory Factor Analysis, what is the primary purpose of factor rotation?
a) To increase the total variance explained by factors
b) To simplify and improve the interpretability of factor loadings
c) To increase the correlation between factors
d) To decrease the number of factors extracted
Answer 22: b) To simplify and improve the interpretability of factor loadings
Explanation: The primary purpose of factor rotation is to simplify and improve the interpretability of factor loadings by redistributing the variance from earlier factors to later ones, leading to a simpler, theoretically more meaningful factor pattern.
Incorrect answer explanations:
a) Factor rotation does not directly increase the total variance explained by factors.
c) Factor rotation does not primarily aim to increase the correlation between factors; orthogonal rotations maintain uncorrelated factors, while oblique rotations allow for correlated factors.
d) Factor rotation does not directly affect the number of factors extracted.
