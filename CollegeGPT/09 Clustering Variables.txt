What is
Exploratory Factor Analysis?
• An interdependence technique whose primary purpose is to define the underlying structure among the variables in the analysis.
• Examines the interrelationships among a large number of variables and then attempts to explain them in terms of their common underlying dimensions.
• These common underlying dimensions are referred to as factors or components.
• EFA is a summarization and data reduction technique that does not have independent and dependent variables but is an interdependence technique in which all variables are considered simultaneously.

1 Objectives of EFA
Three elements in Variable selection in EFA
• Variable specification – researcher must specifically designate variables to be analyzed.
• Factors are always produced – EFA always generates factors, researcher has the responsibility to evaluate the usefulness and validity of the factors.
• Factors require multiple variables – EFA must have at least two correlated variables to form a factor.  Thus, variables which are not included in a specified factor are not “defective” in some manner, it is just that no other correlated variables were included in the analysis.

Using Factor Analysis with Other Multivariate Techniques
• Factors may identify concepts more useful than individual variables.
• Factors help mitigate the impact of multicollinearity on the interpretation of correlated variables.

Measurement level of the variables used in EFA
• Metric variables preferred
• Specialized methods (which we will not discuss) exist for the use of dummy variables
• According to Hair (2019) A small number of “dummy variables” can be included in a set of metric variables that are factor analyzed.

Number of variables per factor (rule of thumb)
• If a study is being designed to reveal a factor structure, strive to have at least five variables for each proposed factor.

Sample size in EFA
• The sample must have more observations than variables.
• The minimum absolute sample size should be 50 observations, with 100 observations the preferred minimum.
• Increase the sample as the complexity of the factor analysis increases (i.e., number of variables and/or factors retained).
• Strive to maximize the number of observations per variable, with a desired ratio of at least 5 observations per variable.
• Higher communalities among the variables provides support for smaller samples sizes, all other things equal.

3 Assumptions in EFA
Statistical issues addressing multicollinearity
• A statistically significant Bartlett’s test of sphericity (sig. < .05) indicates that sufficient correlations exist among the variables to proceed with an exploratory factor analysis.
• More diagnostic test is the MSA  (measure of sampling adequacy).
- Measured by the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) statistic that indicates if a set of variables is likely identify a good factor solution based on correlations/partial correlations.
- KMO statistic exists for each individual variable and an overall value that can vary from 0 to 1.0.
- KMO value must exceed .50 for the overall test

4 Deriving Factors and Assessing Overall Fit
Partitioning the variance
• Variables ideally hold variance.
• This variance can be partitioned in
• Common variance
• Unique variance
• Specific variance
• Error variance

Common variance
• Variance of a variable that is shared with all other variables in the analysis.
• Results from a variable’s correlations with all other variables in the analysis.
• Variable communality is the estimate of its shared, or common, variance among the variables as represented by the derived factors.

Unique variance
• Specific variance
cannot be explained by the correlations to the other variables but reflects the unique characteristics of that variable apart from the other variables in the analysis.
• Error variance
due to unreliability in the data-gathering process, measurement error, or a random component in the measured phenomenon.

Data reduction is the primary concern in PCA
• focusing on the minimum number of factors needed to account for the maximum portion of the total variance represented in the original set of variables.
• prior knowledge suggests that specific and error variance represent a relatively small proportion of the total variance, or
• the principal component results are used as a preliminary step in the scale development process.

How many factors to extract?
• In a data driven context this is not specified in advance.
• There are criteria which can be used:
• Kaiser Criterion
Eigenvalue of 1.0 or greater
• Percentage of cumulative variance
Extract enough components to achieve a specified cumulative percentage of total variance extracted. Usually, 50%.

5 Interpreting the factors
Three processes of Factor Interpretation
• Estimate the Factor matrix
• Factor Rotation
• Factor Interpretation and Respecification

Three processes of Factor Interpretation
• Estimate the Factor matrix
• Compute unrotated factor loadings – correlation of variable and factor.
• If used strictly for data reduction, process can stop here (usually we want to interpret results however).
• Factor Rotation
• Factor Interpretation and Respecification
• evaluate the (rotated) factor loadings for each variable in order to determine that variable’s role and contribution in determining the factor structure.
• Respecification involves eliminating variables or extract different number of factors.

5 Interpreting the factors
Rotations of factors
• Procedure
- The reference axes of the factors are turned about the origin until some other position has been reached. Loadings of each variable remain fixed relative to other loadings.
• Impact
- The ultimate effect of rotating the factor matrix is to redistribute the variance from earlier factors to later ones to achieve a simpler, theoretically more meaningful factor pattern.
• Alternative Methods
- Orthogonal rotation – simplest approach which maintains orthogonality (uncorrelatedness) of factors.
• Most common method – VARIMAX.
- Oblique rotation – allows for correlation among rotated factors.
• Most common method – OBLIMIN.

Rotations of factors
• Orthogonal rotation methods  . . .
- are the most widely used rotational methods.
- are the preferred method when the research goal is data reduction to either a smaller number of variables or a set of uncorrelated measures for subsequent use in other multivariate techniques.
• Oblique rotation methods  . . .
- best suited to the goal of obtaining several theoretically meaningful factors or constructs because, realistically, very few constructs in the “real world” are uncorrelated.

Judging the Significance of Factor Loadings
• Factor loadings are correlations (= r) between a variable and a factor.

• Statistical Significance
- Ensuring adequate statistical power, significant loadings can be identified by sample size.

Giving the factor a name/interpretation
• It might be useful to give the resulting factors a name so they can be easily identified.
• You do so based on the variables that load on the factor.
• It is a subjective interpretative process.

6 Turning Factors into variables
Various methods exist, only one is correct
• Use highest loading variable
- Does not represent all ‘facets’ of a factor.
- Prone to measurement error.
• Calculated mean from highly loading factors
- Again, only a selection.
- Not a weighted contribution.
- Issues analyzing reliability and validity.

Various methods exist, only one is correct
• Software calculates factors scores
- represents all variables loading on the factor.
- Weighted scores
- best method for complete data reduction.
- Disadvantages:
- interpretation more difficult since all variables contribute through loadings.
- difficult to replicate across studies.
