# Design Recommendation

## Summary

This document outlines the design for a local web application that interacts with different Language Model (LLM) providers. The application allows users to select an LLM provider and model, define system and user prompts, and display/save the LLM's output. The core technology choice is TypeScript for both frontend and backend to ensure type safety and code reusability.

## Key Factors Considered

*   **Maintainability:** Using TypeScript for both frontend and backend simplifies development and maintenance.
*   **Extensibility:** The design should easily accommodate new LLM providers and features.
*   **User Experience:** The interface should be intuitive and easy to use.
*   **Security:** While primarily local, we'll still follow best practices for input sanitization and API interaction.
*   **Scalability:** Not a primary concern for a local application, but the design should not hinder future scalability if needed.

## Recommended Approach

We'll use a client-server architecture. The frontend will be a Single Page Application (SPA) built with TypeScript, using a framework-agnostic approach (vanilla TypeScript with minimal dependencies) for simplicity. The backend will be a lightweight Node.js server (using Express.js for simplicity) also written in TypeScript. Communication between the client and server will be through a RESTful API.

The choice of framework-agnostic (vanilla JS) app is justified because:
- The requirements are straight-forward.
- A framework would add complexity.
- We want to show the details of the implementation.

## Rejected Alternatives

*   **Python Backend (Flask/Django):** While viable, using TypeScript for both client and server streamlines development and reduces context switching.
*   **Frontend Frameworks (React, Angular, Vue):** These are overkill for this simple application and would add unnecessary complexity.
*   **Monolithic Architecture:** Separating client and server allows for independent scaling and development if requirements change.

## Trade-offs

*   **Strengths:** Simple, maintainable, easy to understand, and extensible.
*   **Weaknesses:** Might not be as feature-rich as using a dedicated frontend framework. Performance might be slightly lower than a highly optimized framework-based solution for very complex interactions (not expected here). Manual handling of DOM updates.
