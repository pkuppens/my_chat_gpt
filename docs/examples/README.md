# Example Issues for AI Review Workflow

This directory contains example GitHub issues that demonstrate best practices and serve as test cases for the AI-powered issue review workflow.

## Overview

The examples in this directory show:
- Well-structured issues that meet SMART criteria
- Clear title and description alignment
- Comprehensive acceptance criteria
- Proper use of issue templates
- Expected AI review feedback

## Available Examples

### 1. Software Reverse Engineering Documentation Tool
**File**: `EXAMPLE_REVERSE_ENGINEERING_ISSUE.md`

A comprehensive example of a Feature Request/Change Request that demonstrates:
- Clear problem statement and proposed solution
- Detailed acceptance criteria and technical requirements
- Example input/output for the proposed feature
- Success metrics and timeline
- Risk analysis and mitigation strategies

This example is specifically requested in the original issue as a proof of concept for the AI review workflow.

## How to Use These Examples

### For Testing the Workflow
1. Copy the content from an example file
2. Create a new GitHub issue in the repository
3. Paste the content (Title and Description sections)
4. Submit the issue
5. Wait for the AI review workflow to run
6. Compare the actual review with the "Expected AI Review Feedback" section

### For Learning Best Practices
Review these examples to understand:
- How to write clear, actionable issue titles
- What information to include in issue descriptions
- How to structure acceptance criteria
- How to make issues SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)

### For Creating New Issues
Use these examples as templates when creating your own issues:
1. Start with a clear, descriptive title
2. Include a problem statement (what needs to be solved)
3. Describe the proposed solution
4. List specific acceptance criteria
5. Add relevant technical requirements
6. Include success metrics when applicable
7. Estimate timeline if possible
8. Identify dependencies and risks

## What Makes a Good Issue?

Based on the AI review criteria, good issues should have:

### Clear Title
- Concise (< 80 characters)
- Action-oriented (use verbs like "Implement", "Fix", "Add", "Update")
- Specific (avoid vague terms like "improve", "enhance" without context)

### Well-Structured Description
- **Problem Statement**: What problem are we solving? Why is it important?
- **Proposed Solution**: How will we solve it? What approach will we take?
- **Acceptance Criteria**: What must be true for this to be complete?
- **Context**: Any background information, related issues, or dependencies

### SMART Criteria
- **Specific**: Clear scope and deliverables
- **Measurable**: Concrete success metrics or completion criteria
- **Achievable**: Realistic given available resources
- **Relevant**: Aligns with project goals and priorities
- **Time-bound**: Has estimated timeline or deadline

### Additional Best Practices
- Use checklists for multi-step tasks
- Include code examples or mockups when relevant
- Link to related issues or documentation
- Specify affected components or modules
- Consider adding user stories for features
- Include test scenarios when applicable

## Issue Types and Templates

### Bug Reports Should Include
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, browser, versions)
- Error messages or logs
- Screenshots or videos if applicable

### Feature Requests Should Include
- Use case or user story
- Acceptance criteria
- Mockups or examples
- Alternative solutions considered
- Business value or impact

### Epics Should Include
- High-level goals and vision
- Breakdown into sub-issues or tasks
- Timeline and milestones
- Dependencies and risks
- Success metrics

### Tasks Should Include
- Clear, actionable description
- Specific deliverables
- Definition of done
- Estimated effort if known

### Questions Should Include
- Context and background
- What you've already tried
- Specific question(s)
- Code examples or relevant files

1. Create a new markdown file in this directory
2. Follow the structure of existing examples
3. Include both the issue content and expected AI feedback
4. Update this README to list the new example
5. Test the example by creating an actual GitHub issue
