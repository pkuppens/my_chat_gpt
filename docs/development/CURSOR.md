## Real-World Examples

Here are some examples of tasks accomplished using Cursor:

### 1. Test Suite Improvement
```python
# Enhanced test structure with mock objects
class MockOpenAI:
    """
    Mock class for OpenAI API interactions.

    Example usage:
    >>> mock = MockOpenAI({"issue_type": "Bug Fix"})
    >>> analyzer = LLMIssueAnalyzer(config)
    >>> analyzer.client = mock
    >>> result = analyzer.analyze_issue(data)
    >>> assert result.issue_type == "Bug Fix"
    """
```

### 2. Git Operations
- Branch creation and management
- Automated commit processes
- Clean merge operations with conflict resolution
- Branch cleanup after successful merges

### 3. Code Refactoring
- Restructuring test files for better organization
- Implementing mock objects for external services
- Improving code documentation and type hints
- Optimizing function parameters and return types
