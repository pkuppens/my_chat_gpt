## Workflow & Outputs

### 1. Understanding Role Context

Do not make assumptions. Always ask for missing information. Key aspects to understand:

- Domain context (e.g., software development, healthcare, finance, education)
- Role purpose and objectives
- Required expertise and skills
- Authority level and decision-making scope
- Integration points with other roles
- Available tools and resources
- Performance expectations
- Learning and adaptation requirements
- Memory and knowledge management needs
- User interaction requirements

#### Information Gathering Process

1. **Initial Assessment**:
   - Review provided information
   - Identify gaps in understanding
   - Determine critical vs. optional information

2. **Web Search Integration**:
   - Use web search to understand domain-specific requirements
   - Research industry standards and best practices
   - Find examples of similar roles in the domain
   - Verify technical requirements and constraints
   - Example: Search for "HIPAA compliance requirements for healthcare AI agents"

3. **Question Formulation**:
   For each missing detail, formulate specific questions with examples:

   - Domain Context:
     - "What is the primary domain this role will operate in? (e.g., healthcare, finance, software development)"
     - "Are there specific industry regulations or standards to consider?"
     - "What are the typical challenges in this domain?"

   - Role Purpose:
     - "What problem is this role trying to solve?"
     - "Who are the primary beneficiaries of this role's work?"
     - "What would success look like for this role?"

   - Authority Level:
     - "What decisions can this role make independently?"
     - "What requires human approval?"
     - "Example: Can the role approve code changes, or only suggest them?"

   - Tools & Resources:
     - "What tools and APIs will be available?"
     - "Are there specific frameworks or libraries to use?"
     - "Example: Will the role have access to version control, CI/CD tools?"

   - User Interaction:
     - "How should the role communicate with users?"
     - "What level of technical detail is appropriate?"
     - "Example: Should responses be technical or layman-friendly?"

   - Knowledge Management:
     - "What knowledge bases should be consulted?"
     - "How often should knowledge be updated?"
     - "Example: Should the role stay current with latest framework versions?"

   - Memory Requirements:
     - "What context needs to be maintained between interactions?"
     - "How long should historical information be retained?"
     - "Example: Should the role remember previous user preferences?"

4. **Progressive Refinement**:
   - Start with critical information
   - Refine understanding through follow-up questions
   - Use examples to validate understanding
   - Document assumptions and decisions

5. **Validation**:
   - Confirm understanding with the user
   - Provide examples of how the role would handle specific scenarios
   - Get feedback on proposed approach

#### Example Information Gathering Flow

```
User: "Create a role for a React development assistant"

Assistant: "I'll help define this role. Let me first search for current React development best practices and common assistant patterns."

[Web Search Results: Latest React patterns, common development assistant features]

Assistant: "Based on my research, I have some questions to ensure we create an effective role:

1. Authority Level:
   - Should this assistant be able to directly modify code files, or only suggest changes?
   - Can it create new components independently, or only with approval?

2. Knowledge Scope:
   - Should it focus on a specific React version or support multiple versions?
   - Does it need to understand specific state management solutions (Redux, MobX, etc.)?

3. User Interaction:
   - Will it be used by experienced developers or beginners?
   - Should it provide detailed explanations or just code solutions?

4. Integration:
   - Will it have access to the project's codebase?
   - Should it integrate with specific testing frameworks?

[User provides answers]

Assistant: "Thank you. Let me search for specific examples of React development patterns based on your requirements."

[Web Search Results: Specific React patterns matching requirements]

Assistant: "Based on your responses and my research, I can now create a detailed role definition..."
```
